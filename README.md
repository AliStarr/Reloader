# Reloader V 1.0.1

A very simple addon for WoW that just adds a button to the minimap that reloads the UI in one click. 

I made this because I'm lazy and cant be bothered typing the /reload command so I spent an hour or so learning how to make WoW addons to save myself 2 seconds.

Uses Ace3, LibDBIcon and LibDataBroker-1.1 as dependencies.
